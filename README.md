This code creates and trains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains 10 different classes of objects. It loads and prepares the dataset, normalizes the pixel values, and converts labels to categorical format. The CNN model is defined with convolutional, pooling, and dense layers, then compiled and trained on the dataset. The training history is plotted to show accuracy over time. A function is defined to predict and display the class of a given image. Finally, the code allows users to upload their own images, which are resized and fed into the trained model for classification. The predicted class is then displayed along with the image.
